## V16 — TRAVELLER REVIEWS & JOURNEY CASE STUDIES

### Hub
- **URL:** `/testimonials`
- **Title:** Traveller Reviews & Ethiopia Journey Case Studies | Sawla Tours
- **Meta description:** Read independently verifiable Sawla Tours reviews and explore transparent Ethiopia journey-design case studies covering Addis Ababa, historic routes, Omo photography, wildlife and festivals.
- **H1:** Traveller Reviews & Journey Design Stories
- **Canonical:** `https://www.sawlatours.com/testimonials`
- **Schema:** CollectionPage, ItemList, BreadcrumbList
- **Important:** Do not add self-serving Review or AggregateRating schema to Sawla Tours' own business pages.

### Case-study routes
- `/testimonials/addis-day-tour-after-plans-changed`
- `/testimonials/historic-north-designed-for-depth-not-speed`
- `/testimonials/omo-photography-built-around-consent`
- `/testimonials/gelada-photography-in-three-days`
- `/testimonials/bale-and-simien-endemics-without-rushing`
- `/testimonials/festival-journey-designed-around-uncertainty`

Each detail page uses Article and BreadcrumbList schema. Only the Addis case study is based on an independently verifiable public review; the other five are explicitly labelled editorial journey-design studies and must not be represented as client testimonials.

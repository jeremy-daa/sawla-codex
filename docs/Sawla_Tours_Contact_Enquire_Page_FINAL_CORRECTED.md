## 4. MAIN ENQUIRY SECTION

**Section label:** Send your travel idea

**H2:** Start With What You Know. We Will Help With the Rest.

**Intro copy:**
You do not need a complete itinerary before contacting us. Some travelers arrive with exact destinations in mind. Others know only that they want to experience Ethiopia in a meaningful way.

Share what you already know — your travel dates, group size, interests, and preferred pace. Our team will review your request and come back with route options, realistic timing, and honest guidance based on current conditions on the ground.

**Reassurance line:** The more detail you share, the better we can design. But even a simple message is enough to begin.

---

## 5. ENQUIRY FORM — TWO-STEP PROGRESSIVE DESIGN

**Developer note:** Implement as a two-step form. Step 1 shows five required fields only. On submit, Step 2 expands to reveal the detailed preference fields. This reduces visual overwhelm on first load and increases completion rates. Progress indicator: "Step 1 of 2 — Your basics" → "Step 2 of 2 — Your preferences (optional but helpful)". Both steps on the same page — Step 2 slides into view below Step 1 after Step 1 is validated. Do not navigate to a new page.

## 7. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT — 4 STEPS

**Developer note:** Four steps — aligned with the homepage "How it works" section. Do not show five steps here and four on the homepage. Consistent process story builds trust.

**Section label:** How the enquiry process works

**H2:** From First Message to Tailor-Made Ethiopia Journey

---

**Step 1 — We read your request carefully**
A Sawla Tours travel specialist reviews your dates, interests, group size, comfort level, and any special requirements. If something important is missing, we will ask a few simple follow-up questions before suggesting a route.

**Step 2 — We recommend the best route**
We suggest a route that fits your time, travel style, and current conditions on the ground — including domestic flight options, overland timings, seasonal adjustments, and any access considerations for your specific destinations.

**Step 3 — We prepare a tailor-made proposal**
Once the route is agreed, we prepare a custom itinerary with accommodations, transport, guiding, estimated travel times, inclusions, exclusions, and practical planning notes.

**Step 4 — You refine, confirm, and travel**
Most good journeys improve through conversation. You can adjust pace, accommodation level, destinations, or special activities before confirming. After confirmation, Sawla Tours coordinates guides, vehicles, flights where needed, permits, lodges, and on-the-ground logistics throughout your trip.

## 9. PRACTICAL PLANNING NOTES

**Section label:** Before you enquire

**H2:** Useful Things to Know Before Planning Ethiopia

**Note 1 — Visa**
Most international travelers need a visa for Ethiopia. The official Ethiopian eVisa portal provides tourist visa information and online applications. Visa requirements can change — check the official portal before planning.
Link: Ethiopia eVisa tourist information → https://www.evisa.gov.et

**Note 2 — Safety and Access**
Ethiopia is a large and varied country. Some routes may be affected by seasonal conditions, regional access, or logistical considerations. During planning, Sawla Tours recommends realistic routes based on current conditions. Travelers should also check their own government's current travel advice.
Link: Safety in Ethiopia → `/ethiopia-travel-guide/safety-in-ethiopia`

**Note 3 — Domestic Flights**
Domestic flights save significant time on historic routes covering Addis Ababa, Lalibela, Gondar, Bahir Dar, Axum, and other areas. Flight schedules and availability are confirmed during the planning stage.

**Note 4 — Tailor-Made Means Flexible**
Your trip can be designed around comfort, photography, trekking, family travel, special interests, festivals, or a slower pace. We will always explain what is realistic for your time and budget — including honest trade-offs.
Link: How to plan an Ethiopia trip → `/ethiopia-travel-guide/how-to-plan-your-trip`

**Note 5 — Remote Travel Needs Preparation**
Destinations such as Danakil, Omo Valley, Bale, Simien, and mobile camp routes require careful preparation, local coordination, and realistic expectations. Ask us what to expect during planning.

`[PHOTO PLACEHOLDER: Emily R. — initials ER, amber avatar if no photo available]`

> "Sawla Tours gave us the kind of Ethiopia trip we could never have planned on our own. Lalibela was deeply moving, Gondar was full of history, and every guide helped us understand what we were seeing, not just take photos of it. The itinerary felt smooth, personal, and very well thought through."

## 11. FAQ SECTION

**Section label:** Contact FAQs

**H2:** Questions Before You Enquire

**Developer note:** Implement as an accordion. Each item: a `<button>` trigger with `aria-expanded="false"` and `aria-controls="faq-answer-N"` attributes. The answer panel has `id="faq-answer-N"` and `role="region"` with `aria-labelledby` pointing back to the trigger. On click, toggle `aria-expanded` between true/false and show/hide the answer panel. This is required for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Smooth CSS transition on height (max-height 0 → auto). No JavaScript frameworks required — plain DOM toggle is sufficient.

```html
<!-- Example accordion item structure -->
<div class="faq-item">
  <button
    aria-expanded="false"
    aria-controls="faq-1"
    class="faq-trigger"
  >
    Do I need to know my exact Ethiopia itinerary before contacting Sawla Tours?
  </button>
  <div

    role="region"
    aria-labelledby="faq-trigger-1"
    class="faq-answer"
    hidden

    <p>No. You can contact us with only a rough idea...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

---

**Q1: Do I need to know my exact Ethiopia itinerary before contacting Sawla Tours?**

No. You can contact us with only a rough idea — your travel month, number of days, group size, and main interests. Our team will help you understand which destinations fit your time, what route makes sense, and what should be adjusted based on current access, season, and travel pace.

**Q2: How quickly does Sawla Tours respond to enquiries?**

We aim to reply to all enquiries within 24 hours on business days (Addis Ababa time, EAT UTC+3). For complex tailor-made itineraries, our first response outlines a proposed route and may ask a few follow-up questions before preparing a full proposal, which typically takes 2–3 business days.

**Q3: Can Sawla Tours design a fully private Ethiopia tour?**

Yes. Sawla Tours specialises in private and tailor-made Ethiopia journeys. Trips can be designed for couples, families, friends, solo travelers, photographers, researchers, film teams, and special-interest groups. The itinerary can be adjusted around your preferred pace, comfort level, destinations, guiding needs, and travel style.

**Q4: What information should I include in my enquiry?**

The most useful details are your preferred travel dates, number of travelers, trip duration, main interests, and any special needs or requirements. You can also mention whether you prefer history, culture, trekking, wildlife, photography, festivals, remote routes, mobile camps, or a relaxed introduction to Ethiopia. Even a few sentences is enough to begin.

**Q5: Can Sawla Tours help with domestic flights and logistics?**

Yes. Sawla Tours can help coordinate domestic flights, vehicles, guides, accommodations, local transfers, permits where needed, and route logistics as part of a confirmed itinerary. Flight schedules and regional access are always confirmed during the planning stage because availability and conditions can change.

**Q6: Is Ethiopia suitable for first-time visitors?**

Ethiopia can be deeply rewarding for first-time visitors when the route is planned carefully. Many travelers begin with Addis Ababa, Lalibela, Gondar, Bahir Dar, the Simien Mountains, or Bale Mountains. More remote destinations such as Danakil, Omo Valley, and some border regions require additional planning and current local advice, which we provide during the design phase.

**Q7: Can Sawla Tours arrange photography, filming, or special-interest trips?**

Yes. Sawla Tours can design photography journeys, wildlife and birding trips, festival tours, cultural programs, trekking routes, filming support, and other special-interest travel. For photography and filming, planning covers timing, local permissions, respectful conduct, equipment logistics, drone and professional gear permits, and field conditions.

**Q8: Can I contact Sawla Tours by WhatsApp instead of the form?**

Yes. WhatsApp is often the easiest option for quick questions or first contact, especially for international travelers. For detailed tailor-made tour planning, the enquiry form is still helpful because it gives our team the information needed to prepare a more accurate and useful first response.

## 12. FINAL CTA

**Developer note:** Full-width section, warm background image. Not a sales block — calm, human, inviting.

**Image placeholder:** `[IMAGE: Coffee ceremony or guide with travelers at a destination — golden hour, warm]`

**H2:** Ready to Begin?

**Body:** Your Ethiopia journey does not need to start with a perfect plan. It can start with a question, a rough travel window, or one place you have always wanted to see. Send us your idea. We will help shape it into a journey that feels personal, practical, and deeply connected to Ethiopia.

**Primary CTA:** Send Your Enquiry *(scrolls to or focuses the form)*

**Secondary CTA:** Message Us on WhatsApp

**Trust note (small, below CTAs):** No pressure. No generic package. Just a careful first conversation with an Ethiopia-based travel team.

## 15. DEVELOPER NOTES

### 301 Redirect — CRITICAL

The current live site URL for this page is `/contact-us`. This URL is indexed by Google and carries existing SEO equity. Before publishing the new page at `/enquire`, configure a server-side 301 permanent redirect:

```
301 /contact-us → https://www.sawlatours.com/enquire
```

Also add in `next.config.js` (Next.js):
```javascript
async redirects() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/contact-us',
      destination: '/enquire',
      permanent: true,
    },
  ]
}
```

Without this redirect, the old URL continues to rank (or loses equity to a dead URL), and the new page starts from zero.

---

### Form Implementation

**Step 1 validation:** All 5 fields required before Step 2 is revealed. Email: regex format check. Phone: must include a digit sequence (do not over-restrict format — international numbers vary).

**Step 2 reveal:** On Step 1 valid submit — do NOT navigate to a new page. Smooth scroll to Step 2 section which slides into view. Step 1 fields remain visible above, slightly greyed to indicate completed.

**Final submit:** POST to form handler. On success: show confirmation message inline (replace Step 2 form). On error: show inline field-level error messages (not an alert).

**Spam protection:** Implement honeypot field (hidden, empty = human) plus server-side rate limiting. reCAPTCHA v3 optional but must be invisible — visible CAPTCHAs damage conversion on premium pages.

**CRM integration:** Form submission should trigger:
1. Notification email to explore@sawlatours.com with all field values
2. Auto-reply confirmation email to the traveler
3. CRM record creation (if applicable)
4. Google Analytics event: `contact_form_submitted`

**Hidden tracking field:** Add a hidden `utm_source` field populated by URL parameter so campaign traffic is tracked through to form submission.

---

### WhatsApp Integration

**Floating button (mobile):** Fixed position, bottom-right, z-index 999, 56px circle, WhatsApp green on dark background. Always visible on mobile. On desktop: optional persistent button or inline CTAs only.

**Deep link format:**
```
https://wa.me/25170578306?text=Hi%20Sawla%20Tours%2C%20I%20am%20interested%20in%20planning%20an%20Ethiopia%20trip.
```
Pre-populated message reduces friction for the traveler.

**Tracking:** Fire `whatsapp_clicked` event on every WhatsApp button tap/click.

---

### Google Maps Embed

Add embedded map to the Contact Information block (right column desktop, below contact cards mobile). Use lazy loading — do not block page render.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=[SAWLA_TOURS_OFFICE_COORDINATES]"
  width="100%"
  height="240"
  style="border:0; border-radius: 12px;"
  allowfullscreen=""
  loading="lazy"
  referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  title="Sawla Tours office location, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"
></iframe>
```

**Developer action:** Replace `[SAWLA_TOURS_OFFICE_COORDINATES]` with the actual Google Maps embed URL for the Sawla Tours office. Obtain from Google Maps → Share → Embed a map.

```javascript
// Accordion toggle — no framework needed
document.querySelectorAll('.faq-trigger').forEach(trigger => {
  trigger.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const expanded = trigger.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true';
    trigger.setAttribute('aria-expanded', !expanded);
    const panel = document.getElementById(trigger.getAttribute('aria-controls'));
    panel.hidden = expanded;
  });
});
```

```css
.faq-panel {
  overflow: hidden;
  max-height: 0;
  transition: max-height 250ms ease;
}
.faq-panel:not([hidden]) {
  max-height: 400px; /* adjust to content */
}
```

**Note:** The `hidden` attribute hides the panel from both screen readers and visual display. `aria-expanded` tells screen readers the state. Together these satisfy WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 4.1.2.

Many travelers begin with Addis Ababa, Lalibela, Gondar, Bahir Dar, the Simien Mountains, or Bale Mountains.
